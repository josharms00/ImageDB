# ImageDB
A project I made in school using node.js. The server has a database of images that a client can connect and request. If the image exists then it will save it in the client directory and display it. To run server navigate to server directory and type node ImageDB. To request an image from the server navigate to the client directory and type node GetImage -s 127.0.0.1:3000 -q &lt;image-name> [-v &lt;version.].
